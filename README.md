# Weather App w/ React and Redux!

This will be a weather app that uses the open weather map api to list the 5 day weather forcast of a city the user searches for. 

Issue: OpenWeatherMap uses Victoria NFLD as the search result for Victoria, Oak Bay NB for Oak Bay, and doesn't like Saanich. Try Esquimalt for CRD weather.
